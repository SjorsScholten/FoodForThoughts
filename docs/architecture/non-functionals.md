## What non-functionals are important to the context of our application, and why?

- **Scalability:** our application will have to manage a large amount of users. A scalable application is important, so it could handle the load.
- **Availability:** our application should always be running and downtime should be kept as low as possible.
- **Reliability:** Our application should be able to handle crashes. When a service crashes the system should launch the service again.
- **Security:** Our application should be secure. There shouldn't be any possibility of data leaking. Critical information should be encrypted.
